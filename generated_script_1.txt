kramer: hey!!!

elaine: hey, how 'bout a couple of years ago, i mean, i think i'll be a vegetable out of darkness. i think i may have been a millionaire.

george: what about you two?!

jerry:(to elaine) you know.

jerry: what?

jerry:(to elaine) you know, i have to do this, i have to be able to get my spare key.

george: oh no. i don't want to talk about it, you can go to the bathroom.

george:(to kramer) hey listen, i am sorry!

elaine: i can't!

jerry: well, i don't want you to see the doctor anymore.

jerry: oh, i think it's a little awkward.

elaine: oh, come on, let's go.

kramer:(holding up a gun) oh, i can't!

jerry:(to elaine) what is wrong with you?

george: i don't know.
