    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",

    "**Answer:** I first tried a sequence length of 100. The model achieved a loss value of less than 3.5 after 4 epochs. However, the model took a long time to train on GPU at approximately one hour per epoch. Through experimentation, I reduced the sequence length to 10, and the result is that the model trains much quicker and achieves better loss performance. Following the rubric, we want the sequence length to approximately match the typical sentence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss decreased faster using a learning rate of 0.001 compared to 0.01. I chose a mini-batch size of 128 as it was within the 32 to 256 range recommended in the course lectures and used in a course example. Similarly, I used an embedding dimension of 200 because 50 to 200 was recommended in the lesson as a typical range, although sometimes values of up to 500 or 1000 are also used. I chose a hidden dimension of 512 to be a power of two and roughly twice the embedding dimension size. A two-layer LSTM was chosen as opposed to three-layers to reduce training time. I trained the model for 10 epochs because that was more than enough to reach the loss goal of 3.5 in our limited GPU training time."
